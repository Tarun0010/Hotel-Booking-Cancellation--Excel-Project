# Hotel-Booking-Cancellation--Excel-Project
The Hotel Booking Cancellation project using Excel is designed to streamline and manage the process of hotel reservations and cancellations efficiently. This project involves creating an Excel workbook that tracks bookings, guest information, check-in and check-out dates, and the status of each reservation. By using Excel's built-in functions and tools such as pivot tables, data validation, and conditional formatting, the system can provide real-time insights into booking trends, highlight pending or confirmed cancellations, and ensure accurate record-keeping. Additionally, automated formulas can be implemented to calculate refund amounts or cancellation fees, making the management of cancellations straightforward and transparent. This project aims to enhance the operational efficiency of hotel booking management while offering a user-friendly interface for hotel staff.
